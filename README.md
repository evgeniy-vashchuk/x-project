# About

X-Project - is starter template with basic tasks for development, which uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to compile SASS to CSS (with **SCSS** syntax), add vendor prefixes, group media queries, remove comments and minimise CSS, convert ES6 into ES5 using Babel, optimising images, [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) for live-reload while development, simple favicon generator and project archiving. It includes the following libraries and frameworks (as a starting base):

- jQuery

###### A few words about the structure:

**src/** - "source" files to build and develop the project. This is where the original source files are located, before being compiled into fewer files to **dist/**.

Our project follow [SASS guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).
